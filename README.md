## caps-lock.ahk: Caps Lock -> Control or Escape

I use a tweaked version of the script provided in [this excellent blog post](https://www.dannyguo.com/blog/remap-caps-lock-to-escape-and-control/) by Danny Guo.

Previously, I swapped Caps Lock for Escape via [modifying the registry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlPoG7MAt_g). However, this approach is limited to one-to-one replacements and not easily shareable between multiple machines.

## arrow-modifiers.ahk: Alt + arrow keys behave like Home/End/PgUp/PgDn
